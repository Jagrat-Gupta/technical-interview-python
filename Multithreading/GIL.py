The **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)** in Python is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing 
Python bytecodes simultaneously. Here are some key points about the GIL:

### What is the GIL?
- **Definition**: The GIL is a lock that allows only one thread to control the Python interpreter at any given time¹.
- **Purpose**: It ensures that only one thread executes Python code at a time, which helps prevent race conditions and ensures thread safety².

### Why Does Python Have a GIL?
- **Memory Management**: Python uses reference counting for memory management. The GIL protects the reference count variable from race conditions where multiple threads might simultaneously modify it¹.
- **Simplicity**: The GIL simplifies the implementation of CPython, the standard Python interpreter, by avoiding the need for fine-grained locking mechanisms².

### Impact on Performance
- **CPU-bound Tasks**: The GIL can be a bottleneck for CPU-bound tasks because it prevents multiple threads from executing in parallel on multi-core systems¹.
- **I/O-bound Tasks**: For I/O-bound tasks, the impact of the GIL is less significant because threads often spend time waiting for I/O operations to complete, during which the GIL can be released².

### Mitigating the GIL's Impact
- **Multiprocessing**: Using the `multiprocessing` module can bypass the GIL by using separate processes instead of threads, allowing true parallelism¹.
- **C Extensions**: Some C extensions can release the GIL while performing time-consuming tasks, allowing other threads to run².

### Example
Here's a simple example to illustrate the GIL's effect:

```python
import threading

def count():
    x = 0
    for _ in range(1000000):
        x += 1

# Creating threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=count)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=count)

# Starting threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

# Waiting for threads to complete
thread1.join()
thread2.join()

print("Done")
```

In this example, even though two threads are created, they do not run in parallel due to the GIL, especially if the task is CPU-bound¹.
